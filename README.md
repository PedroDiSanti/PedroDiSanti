### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro. I'm 30 years old and have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have been a backend developer for almost 10 years. I consider myself a dynamic, serious person who enjoys finding solutions to problems.

My preferred language is Python, which I have been using for nearly 5 years. I am certified developer by the Python Institute with the PCEP-30-02 certification. With Python as my foundation, I have experience in creating microservices, designing interfaces following REST architecture constraints, and processing massive data through Apache PySpark.

I also have experience in PHP development using Laravel and Symfony frameworks.

I have extensive knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID principles, Clean Code, Design Patterns, Relational Databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, and non-relational databases like MongoDB.

Furthermore, I have experience with cloud services such as AWS and Google Cloud. In AWS, I have worked closely with technologies like SQS/SNS, Cognito, SES, among others. In Google Cloud, I have worked on creating Service Accounts and utilizing Pub/Sub for asynchronous messaging.

I have worked with stream processing using Kafka and sending transactional data using RabbitMQ.

I have some knowledge in requirements gathering, documentation, and UML and ER modeling.

I hold a TOEFL ITP B2 Upper Intermediate (33076) certification.
